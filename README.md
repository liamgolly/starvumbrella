# put all your code here
# always have 1 scratch passive and 1 scratch ult assigned to yourself untill they are all added, and whatever else you want as well
# don't assign yourself to someone elses code unless you really know what you are doing
# start with the very easy to learn to code 
# move to more difficult over time
# if you want to add a new ult/passive do it in the format of Project : (new ult/passive)
# make the name of the uploaded code the name of the class please for convience
# *more advanced* when referencing a rigidbody or sprite, please use .Find to minimize future confusion when we build the complete project
# *more advanced* if you use something really complex, cite your source
# don't copy paste code from the internet
# unlike scratch, you can make variables that already exist here, and it isn't too cluttered, but don't overcomplicate it, the basics are #         completed already
# due dates exist, so complete your code please
# honestly it isn't really possible to do this because unity has sprite and gameobjects that can't be shared here reasonably, so it is best to just put code here and say where it goes in the description, putting code already attached to the main game is just a formality.
